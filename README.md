## Introduction

Welcome to solutions of leetcode algorithms on C language. 

## How to use it?

I suggest to clone repository localy to work with it. But you just look any soulution of you want easly without cloning it. Just `ctrl + f` and type name of question or id of question. Each folder include a md file. You can click to link to go to leetcode website. Also there are two parts of questions;

1. Problem: </br>
  That part includes defination of problem. Example cases. Example input and output. Also includes constraints and follow-up parts.
2. Solution: </br>
  That part includes a table to navigate to Solutions

## Solutions

Each solution md files include;

- Header (that navigate to online explanation of solution)
- Approach (it describes approach to solving the problem)
- Complexity (it determines time and space complexity of solution)
- Code (real solution of problem)

## How to clone it?

> `git clone https://github.com/muffafa/awsome-leetcode-c-solutions.git`
