## time complexity of code two-sum.c is 
### The time complexity of the twoSum function is O(n^2). This is because it uses two nested for-loops, and the number of iterations increases quadratically with the size of the input array (n). For each element in the array, the inner loop checks the sum of that element and every other element in the array, resulting in n * (n-1) / 2 total checks.

## time complexity of code two-sum-hash.c is 
### The time complexity of the twoSum function is O(n), where n is the size of the input array "nums". This is because the algorithm uses a hash table to store the elements in the array and lookup takes O(1) on average. In the worst case, where all the elements have the same hash value, the time complexity would be O(n) as each insertion and lookup takes O(n) in the worst case.
